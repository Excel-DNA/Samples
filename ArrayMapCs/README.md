# ArrayMapCs sample

This project is a C# translation of the `ArrayMap` Visual Basic sample. It defines the same utility functions for working with the Dynamic Arrays feature of Excel.

The following functions are implemented:
* `ARRAY.FROMFILE` - Reads the contents of a delimited file
* `ARRAY.SKIPROWS` - Skips some rows of an array, returning the rest
* `ARRAY.COLUMN` - Returns a single column from an array
* `ARRAY.MAP` - Evaluates the function for every value in the input array, returning an array that has the same size as the input
