# ArrayMap sample

This sample project defines some utility functions that can help make the most of the Dynamic Arrays feature of Excel.

It defines the following functions:
* `ARRAY.FROMFILE` - Reads the contents of a delimited file
* `ARRAY.SKIPROWS` - Skips some rows of an array, returning the rest
* `ARRAY.COLUMN` - Returns a single columns from an array
* `ARRAY.MAP` - Evaluates the function for every value in the input array, returning an array that has the same size as the input
